Files created for the capstone project for the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate

My capstone project for the online course used a subset of the SSAâ€™s USA Names Open Dataset. 
I used BiqQuery to run my SQL query. Copy of the SQL code and generated CSV files are included.

The course showed ways to clean data using queries, spreadsheets, and R. I choose to do data
checks/verification using Excel since I used Google Sheets throughout the course. I could have
also done the cleaning in R and not used Excel. The data set was small so Excel was a good
package to use. Also, I wanted to play with pivot tables since I wanted to used them to verify
results using R code for the plots. The CSV file with the checks I performed are included.

The course used R for the data analysis. I created a few plots for use in the final capstone
presentation. The R code and generated plots are included.

I used Google Slides to generate a quick presentation. The final presentation in PDF format 
is included.
